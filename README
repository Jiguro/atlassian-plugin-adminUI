You have successfully created an Atlassian Plugin!

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
                 - '--product <product name>' starts plugin with given Atlassian product
                 - '--version <version number>' starts given product with specified number
                 - '--http-port <port number>' starts application at given port
                 - '-DskipTests=true' to skip unit tests
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK

Example: atlas-debug --product jira --version 7.4.1 --http-port 2991
